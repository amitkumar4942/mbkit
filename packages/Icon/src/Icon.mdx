# Dev Documentation

Icons and Glyphs are exported as named exports. Find the icon or glyph below you want to use and import them as: 

<EditorOnly language="jsx">import { IconName, GlyphName } from '@mindbody/icons';</EditorOnly>

Contextually, a **glyph** is a typographical character that represents something else. For example, the @ sign is a glyph that commonly represents the phrase at.

Whereas an **icon** is a direct representation of something else. For example, an icon that links to the contents of a hard drive would be a picture of a hard drive.

## Using an Icons

```tsx
<>
    <IconCheckMark color="success" width="100" height="100" />
    <IconCaution color="warning" />
    <IconError color="error" />
    <IconInformation color="info" />
</>
```

## Targeting icons with SCSS 

This snippet targets all path, g, and use elements where they have a fill prop that contains a pound sign which indicates that it is using a hex code. 

<EditorOnly language="scss">
    svg g:not([fill~="#"]),
    svg path:not([fill~="#"]),
    svg use:not([fill~="#"]) { 
        fill: #ffffff;
    }
</EditorOnly>
