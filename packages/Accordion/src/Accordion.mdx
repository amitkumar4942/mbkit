# Accordion Usage

Basic Implementation allows you to pass in the "activePanes" by index and the "onChange" which will pass the index being changed. 

This example shows use where one pane has to be open and only one at a time.

```tsx
<Component initialState={{ activePanes: [0] }}>
  {({ setState, state }) => (
    <Accordion 
        activePanes={state.activePanes} 
        onChange={indexChanged => {
            // Note that this simply overwrites all values of array to current index clicked
            setState({ activePanes: [indexChanged] })
        }}
    >
        <AccordionItem>
            <AccordionHeader>
                Item 1
            </AccordionHeader>
            <AccordionPane>
                Content inside item 1
            </AccordionPane>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem>
            <AccordionHeader>
                Item 2
            </AccordionHeader>
            <AccordionPane>
                Content inside item 2
            </AccordionPane>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem>
            <AccordionHeader>
                Item 3
            </AccordionHeader>
            <AccordionPane>
                Content inside item 3
            </AccordionPane>
        </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  )}
</Component>
```

Here's an example where multiple panes can be open at a time and none has to be open if the user closes them all. 

```tsx
<Component initialState={{ activePanes: [0] }}>
  {({ setState, state }) => (
    <Accordion 
        activePanes={state.activePanes} 
        onChange={indexChanged => {
            const {activePanes} = state;
            // Here we do a check to see if we need to filter out or just add the value.
            // Another option to make sure that the accordion always has one pane open, 
            // is to also check the length to make sure it's at least 1.
            if (activePanes.includes(indexChanged)) {
                setState({
                    activePanes: activePanes.filter(i => i !== indexChanged),
                });
            } else {
                setState({
                    activePanes: [...activePanes, indexChanged],
                });
            }
        }}
    >
        <AccordionItem>
            <AccordionHeader>
                Item 1
            </AccordionHeader>
            <AccordionPane>
                Content inside item 1
            </AccordionPane>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem>
            <AccordionHeader>
                Item 2
            </AccordionHeader>
            <AccordionPane>
                Content inside item 2
            </AccordionPane>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem>
            <AccordionHeader>
                Item 3
            </AccordionHeader>
            <AccordionPane>
                Content inside item 3
            </AccordionPane>
        </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  )}
</Component>
```

Need to pass a clickable element in the header but don't want to trigger the onChange? No problem, just call "stopPropagation" on the click event. 

```tsx
<Component initialState={{ activePanes: [1] }}>
  {({ setState, state }) => (
    <Accordion 
        activePanes={state.activePanes} 
        onChange={indexChanged => {
            const {activePanes} = state;
            if (activePanes.includes(indexChanged)) {
                setState({
                    activePanes: activePanes.filter(i => i !== indexChanged),
                });
            } else {
                setState({
                    activePanes: [...activePanes, indexChanged],
                });
            }
        }}
    >
        <AccordionItem>
            <AccordionHeader style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
                <div style={{ flex: 1, display: 'inline-flex', justifyContent: 'space-between' }}>
                    <div>Item 1</div>
                    <button
                        onClick={e => {
                            // Stop propagation must be called as we check if 
                            // `event.isPropagationStopped()` is true to 
                            // disable the onChange from firing
                            e.stopPropagation();
                            console.log('Button clicked');
                        }}
                    >
                        Do Something Else
                    </button>
                </div>
            </AccordionHeader>
            <AccordionPane>
                Content inside item 1
            </AccordionPane>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem>
            <AccordionHeader>
                Item 2
            </AccordionHeader>
            <AccordionPane>
                Content inside item 2
            </AccordionPane>
        </AccordionItem>
        <AccordionItem>
            <AccordionHeader>
                Item 3
            </AccordionHeader>
            <AccordionPane>
                Content inside item 3
            </AccordionPane>
        </AccordionItem>
    </Accordion>
  )}
</Component>
```

## Accessibility

The accordion components are buil per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion" target="_blank">W3 best practices for accordions</a> for a11y concerns.

### Technical details

Under the hood, "AccordionItem" ties together the "AccordionHeader" and "AccordionPane" so the aria labels correspond as well tell the screen reader if the current pane is open or not. 

### Keyboard shortcuts

The user can use their arrow up/down keys while focused on a header to navigate between headers as well as the "home"/"end" which will focus the first/last header accordingly. While focused on a header the user can press their "Space"/"Enter" key to activate the onChange.
