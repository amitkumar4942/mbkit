The consuming application will be responsible for the showing and hiding of the toaster using the "show" prop. It will handle the transition and placement on the screen.

```tsx
<Toaster show={true} style={{ position: 'static', bottom: 'initial', left: 'initial', animation: 'none' }}>It was a success</Toaster>
```

Click the button below to see the alert show up on screen and watch it disappear in 5 seconds. 

<RenderOnly>
    <ToasterExample message="You've successfully saved something" />
