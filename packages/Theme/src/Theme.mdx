# ThemeProvider and ThemeConsumer Usage

Start by adding a theme provider as the outermost wrapper. This theme provider will generate CSS variables in a scoped selector, as not to overwrite other theme providers, that all common components will use. 

## Demo

Below are two examples of the ThemeProvider, one which just outputs the default theme and another that adds a custom theme. 

Inspect the output and find the scoped selector. On it you will see the CSS variables scoped there.

```tsx
<>
    <ThemeProvider>
        {({theme}) => (
            <>
                Default
                <pre>
                    {JSON.stringify(theme, null, 2)}
                </pre>
            </>
        )}
    </ThemeProvider>

    <ThemeProvider theme={{
        name: "My Custom Theme",
        foreground: 'red',
        background: 'blue',
    }}>
        {({theme}) => (
            <>
                Custom
                <pre>
                    {JSON.stringify(theme, null, 2)}
                </pre>
            </>
        )}
    </ThemeProvider>
</>
```

## FAQ

### When should I use a custom theme?

If you are working in a legacy product and want to match it's styling, you can override the values of the theme and see the common components reflect this.

### Can I use theme values as SCSS variables?

Yes! After you've installed this package as a dependency you can add this line "@import '~@mindbody/theme/dist/theme.scss';" in any of your scss files and it will allow you to consume the SCSS variables. Variable names follow the JSON structure just like the CSS variables. 

For example: "$primary-1" will output "var(--primary-1, #993100)"
