# ThemeProvider and ThemeConsumer Usage

Start by adding a theme provider as the outermost wrapper. This theme provider will generate CSS variables in a scoped selector. 

## Default Theme

Inspect the output and find the scoped selector. You'll see the CSS variables scoped there. 

Also exported is the `mindbodyTheme` and `mindbodyBusinessTheme` following UX/UI

```tsx
import { mindbodyTheme, mindbodyBusinessTheme } from '@mbkit/theme';
```

```tsx
<>
<ThemeProvider>
    {({theme}) => (
        <>
            <pre>
                {JSON.stringify(theme, null, 2)}
            </pre>
        </>
    )}
</ThemeProvider>
</>
```

## Custom Theme

```tsx
<ThemeProvider theme={{
    name: "My Custom Theme",
    foreground: 'red',
    background: 'blue',
}}>
    {({theme}) => (
        <>
            <pre>
                {JSON.stringify(theme, null, 2)}
            </pre>
        </>
    )}
</ThemeProvider>
```

# FAQ

## When should I use a custom theme?

Use a custom theme if you're working in a legacy product and want to match its styling.

## Can I use theme values as SCSS variables?

Yes! After you've installed this package as a dependency, you can add this line in any of your SCSS files and it will allow you to consume them. Variable names follow the same JSON structure as the CSS variables.

> @import '~@mbkit/theme/dist/theme.scss';

For example, **$primary-1** will output **var(--primary-1, #993100)**.
