# Dev Documentation

Treat the Toggle component as you would a checkbox as that's what it is under the hood. 

```tsx
<>
    <Toggle />
    <Toggle size={2} />
    <br />
    <Toggle checked />
    <Toggle checked size={2} />
</>
```

Disabled states

```tsx
<>
    <Toggle disabled />
    <Toggle disabled size={2} />
    <br />
    <Toggle disabled checked />
    <Toggle disabled checked size={2} />
</>
```
