# Card Usage

## Basic Usage

Cards are rendered as divs by default.

```tsx
<Card>
    This is a standard card where you can place content.
</Card>
```

## Render as a Section

It may be useful for semantics to render as an HTML5 section.

```tsx
<Card as="section">
    This card is rendered as a section element using the "as" prop.
</Card>
```
